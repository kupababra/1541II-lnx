Project: Copying C64 Floppy Disks on Linux OPenCBM + XUM1541

## Project Description

The project aims to enable the 1541 II floppy drive (compatible with Commodore 64 computers) to run on Linux.

This will allow users to read, write, and copy data from C64 floppy disks on Linux/BSD systems using tools such as OpenCBM and a dedicated program that works with OpenCBM.

According to the official OpenCBM website, this drive doesn't appear to be functional, so I had to create a program to help get it running. ;-)

## Requirements

- **Linux** (preferred distribution: Debian, Gentoo, Slackware)
- **OpenCBM** - a program for communicating with Commodore 64 computers
- **My Program** - an additional program that works with OpenCBM, allowing easy operation of the 1541 II disk drive on Linux
- **XUM 1541 Interface** + USB cable

### Required Dependencies:

- `openCBM` (in a version compatible with your system)
- `libusb` (if using a USB-connected device)
- `gcc` and other compilation tools (if you need to compile OpenCBM)
- `My Program` (an additional program that works with OpenCBM)

The rest will be here soon. Best regards, bofh@retro cdn ...
